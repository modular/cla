# **Modular, Inc.**

# **CLA**

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the open source project(s) managed
by Modular, Inc. (“Modular”). To clarify the intellectual property license
granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Modular Inc must have a
Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has been signed by each
contributor to any project (each, a “Contributor”), indicating agreement to the
terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor, as well as
the protection of Modular Inc and its users. It does not change your rights to
use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By commenting "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA", You
accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to any Modular project. Except for the license
granted herein to Modular and the recipients of software distributed by Modular
Inc, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. **Definitions.**
   1. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
      authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the
      Modular. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For
      the purposes of this definition, "control" means

      1. the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
         such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,

      2. or ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,

      3. or beneficial ownership of such entity.

   2. **"Contribution"** shall mean any code, documentation or original work of
      authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work,
      that is intentionally submitted by You to Modular for inclusion in, or
      documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Modular
      (**the "Work"**).

      1. For the purposes of this definition, **"submitted"** means any form of
         electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Modular or its
         representatives, including but not limited to communication on
         electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
         tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Modular for the
         purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
         communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
         writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. **Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant Modular and to recipients of software
   distributed by Modular a perpetual, worldwide, non­exclusive, no­charge,
   royalty­free, irrevocable (except as set forth below) copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. **Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to Modular and to recipients of software
   distributed by Modular a perpetual, worldwide, non­exclusive, no­charge,
   royalty­free, irrevocable (except as set forth below) patent license to
   make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation
   against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
   a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have
   contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
   any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that
   Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
   filed.

4. You represent and warrant that You are legally entitled to grant the above
   licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You
   create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have
   received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that
   Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Modular, or
   that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Modular that
   covers Your Contributions.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see
   section 8 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your
   Contribution submissions include complete details of any third ­party
   license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents
   and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated
   with any part of Your Contributions.

6. If You are entering into this CLA as a company, You agree to completely and
   accurately fill out the additional forms set forth in Schedule A.  You
   represent and warrant that (a) the individual accepting this CLA is duly
   authorized to enter into this CLA on the company’s behalf and (b) You have
   all rights and consents necessary to submit Your Contributions.

7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to
   the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free,
   for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
       writing, except for the warranties set forth above, You provide Your
       Contributions on an "AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
       ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
       warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON­-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
       or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
   submit it to Modular separately from any Contribution, identifying the
   complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
   (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
   agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
   work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: \[named here\]".

9. You agree to notify Modular of any facts or circumstances of which You
   become aware that would make any of the representations and warranties
   contained in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.
